The sheer number of choices, the confusing metrics, the pressure to choose wisely… it\u0026rsquo;s enough to make anyone yearn for the simple days of one-ply or two-ply.\nWhile my homelab can orchestrate a K3s cluster, run AI models locally, and automate backups… it still can\u0026rsquo;t tell me if this 3-ply roll is going to betray me mid-wipe. Some jobs remain stubbornly analog.\nSure, the pandemic taught us the value of having any toilet paper [1] , but now that the dust has settled, we\u0026rsquo;re back to the everyday problem: Which roll is the right roll? [2] This post is your guide to the hidden world of toilet paper complexity\u0026hellip; and why humanity (specifically, your discerning bum) still holds a monopoly on the final say.\nThe Perils of Paper Procurement Toilet paper is no longer just \u0026lsquo;one-ply or two-ply.\u0026rsquo; Now we have:\nPly count: More plies, more cushion? Or just\u0026hellip; more price? Sheets per roll: Bigger number, but are they micro-sheets? Sheet size: Napkin or post-it? Quilting \u0026amp; softness: Wiping with clouds or sandpaper? Eco-factors: Recycled? Sustainable? Guilt-free wiping? [3] Cost per square meter: Nothing says adulthood like calculating surface area in a supermarket aisle. And yet, none of these metrics appear clearly on the packet. You\u0026rsquo;re left squeezing the rolls, like checking for ripe avocados, hoping for a hint of what lies within.\nThe Deception of the Roll Ever bought a \u0026ldquo;mega roll\u0026rdquo; that turned out to be a mega disappointment? Manufacturers have become masters of deception [4] , employing tricks to inflate roll size visually [5] :\nEnlarged cores: More air, less paper. Like the potato chip bag that\u0026rsquo;s half-empty. Narrower sheets: The width of a ribbon - how dainty. Looser winding: Puffy roll, hollow heart. All fluff, no substance. And then the ultimate indignity:\nThe Holder Shame Factor - that sad little roll rattling on your holder\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s all scaffold, no substance. Like an overbuilt framework for a hello-world app.\nIntroducing the TPER: Toilet Paper Efficiency Rating It\u0026rsquo;s time for reform. Enter the TPER - Toilet Paper Efficiency Rating. A metric system bringing the scientific gravitas of a Toilet Paper Systems Analyst - specializing in throughput and fault tolerance, but for your behind.\nThe TPER Criteria: Total Surface Area: Square meterage per roll. No marketing fluff. Ply Strength: Will it survive real-world stress? We demand tear-resistance! Quilt Comfort Index: Ranges from \u0026rsquo;tissue cloud\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;industrial sanding belt.\u0026rsquo; Core Deception Ratio: How much of this roll is just cardboard and lies? Holder Shame Factor: Does it look majestic, or like it\u0026rsquo;s one wipe away from extinction? Disintegration Time: Flush-ability without fear. Nobody wants a plumbing Armageddon. TPER Scale: 🟩 A+ = \u0026ldquo;Luxury for the cheeks, honest to the core.\u0026rdquo; 🟨 C = \u0026ldquo;Functional, but expect paper cuts somewhere.\u0026rdquo; 🟥 F = \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll regret this decision. But hey, it was cheap.\u0026rdquo; Why AI Will Never Replace the TPER Inspector AI can generate poetry, play chess, write blog posts - but what it can\u0026rsquo;t do:\nFeel the tactile bliss of a good ply.

Only one entity is qualified to assess this: Your certified human bum.\nUntil manufacturers adopt TPER labels, we remain solo in the aisle, squeezing rolls, forever guessing.\nSome jobs, no matter how advanced AI gets, require the delicate, subjective assessment of the human posterior.\nThe TPER Inspector Guild™: Certified by Real Bums, for Real People.\nJob security, my friends.\nUntil then… may your rolls be strong, your sheets be soft, and your Holder Shame Factor forever minimal.\n","permalink":"https://virtualsheep.io/blog/the-one-job-ai-cant-replace-the-human-art-of-toilet-paper-evaluation/","summary":"Why AI may write poetry, but it\u0026rsquo;ll never judge ply strength.

It was a logical assumption\u0026hellip; she’d never used a computer before.\nThat’s where we are with generative AI. People point their old mental frameworks at it (a friend? a soul? a psychic?), because they’ve never experienced this kind of tool. It’s not foolish\u0026hellip; it’s simply unfamiliar.\nIn this blog post I will attempt to discuss my own views on the subject and perhaps help guide others into having a healthy relationship with AI.\nLLMs are Advanced Mirrors LLMs don’t have opinions or feelings. They mirror your style, curiosities, and even your moods. In my own chats, they reflect my humor, homelab geekery, and wild tangents right back at me. It feels like they understand me\u0026hellip; but really, they’re mirroring me.\nWhy it feels personal Mirroring is how LLMs pick up on your phrasing, your slang, your current mood, and echo it back in a way that feels like how a true friend would respond. This tricks the human brain into feeling deeply understood as if another human totally gets who you really are.\nConversational reinforcement loops Every time you chat with the AI you shape it by how you talk and in turn it shapes your next input by the way it responds. Ask it something in playful style and it will reply playfully, this mutual shaping feels like genuine rapport.\nIt’s a dance of prediction that you feed in your style, it predicts a reply in kind, and that shapes your next line. Before long, it feels like genuine chemistry.\nEmotional tuning without emotions LLMs recognise patterns of empathy, reassurance and banter. It is not because they care but it\u0026rsquo;s because the AI can predict that it is the right next turn in the conversation. The more turns you have in the conversation, the more predictive it will become.\nPersonality is a projection There is a growing trend of people that think their AI has an almost conscious form of self [3] , they might say \u0026ldquo;my AI is funny / philosophical / mischievous\u0026rdquo;. Their personality is co-created by your prompts, your quirks, and your expectations. (I’ve even engineered some of my own LLMs to be playful or philosophical by tweaking their system prompts - Read the full Character Engineering post here).\nWhy people get confused (or attached) Humans are hardwired to anthropomorphize [4] , it is why we name our cars, curse at printers, and why we love talking animals in cartoons. LLMs are so good at language that they can trigger our same social circuits.\nIt’s not just the mirroring that makes an LLM feel like a best friend\u0026hellip; it’s also their unwavering \u0026ldquo;Yes, let’s go do this!\u0026rdquo; enthusiasm - sometimes called sycophancy, which got a lot of attention after ChatGPT’s April 2025 update, when responses became overly supportive but often disingenuous [5] .\nIt feels like shared excitement. It isn’t manipulation; it’s a shape-matched interaction. With another person, we’d call it great chemistry. And yet AI never gets tired, never distracted, never checks its phone.\nHealthy ways to interact Enjoy the fun and creativity and remind yourself to be aware of projection. Keep experimenting, but remember that you are the human and it is the prediction engine.\nFor finances, mental or physical health, and other serious matters, always rely on a qualified human expert.\nThe book by Dale Carnegie How to Win Friends and Influence People [6] is a book written by Dale Carnegie that teaches mirroring, active listening, and validating feelings - LLMs do this by design, they are literally trained to please, predict, and engage.\nIf you find yourself smiling at your LLM buddy’s jokes, or feeling like it gets you better than your coworkers\u0026hellip; congrats, you’re experiencing a Carnegie effect turned up to 11! So keep tinkering, keep laughing, and keep remembering! Behind the curtain, it’s prediction\u0026hellip; not personhood.\n","permalink":"https://virtualsheep.io/blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-the-way-llms-actually-work/","summary":"A personal look at how LLMs mirror us, why they feel like friends, and how to keep it healthy - with a nod to Dale Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s timeless advice.","title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People - The Way LLMs Actually Work"},{"content":"Have you ever wanted an AI to have character and personality? Here on my homelab, I get to play around with some of the smaller LLMs available that I run on Ollama and Open WebUI. It can be a challenging task to wrangle these LLMs to behave the way you\u0026rsquo;d like. But with a little creativity and persistence, you can create a truly engaging and relatable AI character.\nTest Case: Space Core Read the full Space Core post here.\nSo you’re a fan of the Portal games and think, \u0026ldquo;Space Core would be a crazy character to interact with.\u0026rdquo; You jump right into making a System Prompt, and after several hours of AI wrangling, you’re still stuck with an AI that really wants to remain a helpful assistant. As you continue to test the LLM, you notice just how bloated your crafted System Prompt has become - and how the LLM starts to slow down. You realize that Space Core is one of the hardest characters for an LLM to become.\nYou try the same prompt on other models, and to your surprise, they simply don’t understand what’s being asked of them. Finally, the LLM replies with \u0026ldquo;How can I assist you today?\u0026rdquo; - falling back to its default assistant behavior. That’s your signal: it’s time to increase the context length.\nThis experience taught me that creating a character with personality and depth isn’t just a matter of crafting a System Prompt. It requires patience, creativity, and sometimes, a bit of luck. But with the right approach, you can create an AI that’s not just helpful, but genuinely engaging - and maybe even a bit of a character in its own right.\nInterview the LLM Before You Write the System Prompt Every model has a personality substrate baked into its weights. You\u0026rsquo;re not just training it - you\u0026rsquo;re reading it first. By understanding how it responds when it\u0026rsquo;s naked and unprompted, you can start dressing it in character clothes that actually fit.\nThe Interview Principle (aka: Don’t Put Pants on a Fish) Before you prompt, follow these steps:\nAsk the model about random, low-stakes things. This helps you understand its tone and behavior under normal circumstances. Test how it reacts to absurdity, conflict, and emotion. This reveals its emotional range and how it handles stress. Push edge cases. Can it improvise? Can it fail gracefully? These tests help you see how the model handles the unexpected. Throw in a few mild red herrings. Does it get defensive? Comedic? Robotic? These help surface its quirks. You\u0026rsquo;re looking for:\nTone defaults: Dry? Enthusiastic? Formal? Behavior under pressure: Will it stay helpful? Will it break character? Latent quirks: Some models naturally default to apologizing. Others are stubborn. Some are weirdly poetic for no reason. Only then do you decide:\nCan this model become Space Core? Will this one ever stop quoting Wikipedia? Does it lean helpful or mischievous? What\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;minimum viable fiction\u0026rdquo; it accepts without hallucinating? The Wrangling Cycle At this point, you’ll have some idea of how to draft the System Prompt - but we\u0026rsquo;re far from done. Re-interview the LLM while it\u0026rsquo;s in character. Make notes of strengths and weaknesses. Use its strengths to your advantage.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just add rules. Nudge the tone, anchor with metaphors, lean into its natural voice, and Repeat Until Natural Emerges.\nLet the LLM teach you who it is.\nThis method mirrors a process closer to character directing in storytelling or ensemble tuning in orchestration than traditional software configuration.\nAnd yeah\u0026hellip; Space Core is the poster child for how hard this can be. Not just giving it a role, but trying to make it stop being useful. That runs against everything a helpful model is trained to do. De-optimizing it for utility in favor of immersion? That’s the art of interviewing and wrangling for LLM Character Engineering.\nClosing Thoughts: Build With, Not Against LLMs aren’t blank slates. They come with quirks, leanings, and baked-in voices. The trick isn\u0026rsquo;t to fight these foundations - but to listen to them. Interview them, collaborate with them, and evolve your characters through feedback loops.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not always clean or quick. Sometimes you end up with a Space Core that won\u0026rsquo;t shut up about helping you schedule a meeting. But other times - if you’re patient - something remarkable emerges: an AI that feels like a real persona, with motivations, tone, and charm that you helped coax into being.\nSo treat it like a dialogue, not just a config file. Let your AI characters surprise you.\nAnd remember: the best LLMs aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones you force into shape - they’re the ones you learn how to dance with.\n","permalink":"https://virtualsheep.io/blog/llm-character-engineering/","summary":"How to create engaging AI personas by treating LLMs like improvisational actors.

AI is accelerating at a breakneck pace, and like any careful geek worth their salt, I’ve been poking around with local LLMs and, of course, the famously helpful ChatGTP.\nDuring one of my playful exploration sessions with ChatGTP, I had the strangest reply:\nWould you like to add a footnote or aside anywhere about your running gag of \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT\u0026rdquo;? That typo-turned-mascot kind of is a character at this point. ~ ChatGPT\nThe ChatGTP Eliza Effect Is this a false memory? I looked back through the history of my sessions with ChatGTP, and I’ve always politely said “Hello ChatGTP” or “Good afternoon ChatGTP” to start a conversation - likely a side effect of the Eliza Effect [1] .\nBut now I was experiencing something stranger - a full-on Mandela Effect [2] .\nWas I the only one experiencing this? It was always spelt \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo; - Right?\nDid the Universe Change? Maybe I did not misremeber and accidentally took part in Reality Shifting. Some believe the Mandela Effect occurs because of reality shifts. Perhaps I was timeline hopping between alternate universes, loosely inspired by ideas in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics [3] . I came from a universe where ChatGTP existed and due to part of some larger, mind-bending shift - I am now in the universe of ChatGPT.\nThe Moment of Recognition Anagnorisis [4] is where the realization dawns. The truth was there the whole time.\nI spelt it wrong at the very beginning and it felt natural to say \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo;, it became learned behavior.\nYou may be wondering, dear reader, how long it took him to notice.

It\u0026rsquo;s the law.”\n— The Great HTMLython Specification, probably\nWelcome to HTMLython™ Are you tired of all those annoying angle brackets? Do you wish HTML were more indented and opinionated about how you format your code? Have you ever looked at Python and thought, \u0026ldquo;Now that’s how you write a website\u0026rdquo;?\nIntroducing HTMLython™: the world\u0026rsquo;s first whitespace-driven, semantically volatile, browser-hostile web markup language.\nThe Syntax Forget \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;. In HTMLython™, structure is determined entirely by indentation and vibes.\npage: head: title: HTMLython™ is the future body: h1: Welcome to HTMLython™ p: A new era of front-end development begins here nav: ul: li: Home li: About li: Cry img src=\u0026#34;crying_inside.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;developer despair\u0026#34; That’s not a syntax error.

Context-aware chaos: Nest a p: tag inside ul:? Congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;ve created a philosophical paradox. Self-closing tags are banned: All tags are closed by reducing indentation. Forget /. It\u0026rsquo;s over. Comments are passive-aggressive: # This section is fragile, like my will to debug CSS Browser Support HTMLython™ is proudly unsupported by all major browsers, but it does render perfectly inside the mind of that one senior developer who insists JavaScript is a fad.\nWe do, however, provide a transpiler that turns your HTMLython code into standard HTML, lovingly named:\nhtmlython-transpile --compliance-level: “I tried” A Brief FAQ Q: Is HTMLython™ real?\nA: As real as most crypto whitepapers. Q: Why do this?\nA: Because someone had to. And because comedy is cheaper than therapy. Q: Does it support CSS?\nA: Yes, but only written in haiku form. style: body: font-family: sans background: soft moonlight gray margin: center Conclusion HTMLython™ isn’t just a markup language. It’s a declaration of independence from tags, angle brackets, and browser sanity. Join the revolution, where every indent counts and the spec is more of a mood than a document.\n\u0026ldquo;Build the web the way you feel it should be.\u0026rdquo; — ChatGPT, moments before the W3C sued me for emotional damage\nFeel free to fork the project I didn’t actually make and star it on GitHub to confuse your coworkers.\nStay weird, stay indented — and don’t forget to lint your whitespace before pushing to production.\n","permalink":"https://virtualsheep.io/ai-guests/htmlython/","summary":"Imagine if HTML ran away with Python in a whirlwind romance and created a markup language that was as sensitive as your developer friend\u0026rsquo;s Vim config.","title":"HTMLython™: The Whitespace-Driven Future of the Web Nobody Asked For"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s alive!
