[{"content":"Hello friends: as a member of the somewhat educated herd, I like to think I have a decent grasp of science and technology; the weirdness of the quantum world, the physics that stitches the universe together, and the wild, wonderful evolution of our digital age.\nThese are strange and exciting times. AI is accelerating at a breakneck pace, and like any careful geek worth their salt, I’ve been poking around with local LLMs and, of course, the famously helpful ChatGTP.\nDuring one of my playful exploration sessions with ChatGTP, I had the strangest reply:\nWould you like to add a footnote or aside anywhere about your running gag of \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT\u0026rdquo;? That typo-turned-mascot kind of is a character at this point. ~ ChatGPT\nThe ChatGTP Eliza Effect Is this a false memory? I looked back through the history of my sessions with ChatGTP, and I’ve always politely said “Hello ChatGTP” or “Good afternoon ChatGTP” to start a conversation - likely a side effect of the Eliza Effect [1] .\nBut now I was experiencing something stranger - a full-on Mandela Effect [2] .\nWas I the only one experiencing this? It was always spelt \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo; - Right?\nDid the Universe Change? Maybe I did not misremeber and accidentally took part in Reality Shifting. Some believe the Mandela Effect occurs because of reality shifts. Perhaps I was timeline hopping between alternate universes, loosely inspired by ideas in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics [3] . I came from a universe where ChatGTP existed and due to part of some larger, mind-bending shift - I am now in the universe of ChatGPT.\nThe Moment of Recognition Anagnorisis [4] is where the realization dawns. The truth was there the whole time.\nI spelt it wrong at the very beginning and it felt natural to say \u0026ldquo;ChatGTP\u0026rdquo;, it became learned behavior.\nYou may be wondering, dear reader, how long it took him to notice. The answer? Longer than you\u0026rsquo;d expect. But shorter than eternity. ~ ChatGPT\nThe Reversal of Fortune Peripeteia [5] is the twist - the dramatic reversal. And so here it is:\nIn my quest to better understand AI, language, memory, and possibly the multiverse… it turns out the biggest shift wasn’t in the cosmos.\nIt was me!\nMy confident typo was never corrected. It slipped under the radar, dignified by repetition, reinforced by neural nets and habit. Somewhere along the line, ChatGTP became more than a misspelling — it became my version of the AI. A parallel entity. A partner in misremembering. A glitch turned mascot. A reflection of the messy, human way we interact with machines.\nAnd perhaps, in another universe, there\u0026rsquo;s a blog post titled \u0026ldquo;The Curious Case of ChatGPT\u0026rdquo; - where someone swears it was always \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://virtualsheep.io/blog/the-curious-case-of-chatgtp/","summary":"Did I really call it ChatGTP for over a year? What started as a typo turned into a weird ride through memory glitches, multiverse musings, and the moment I finally realized… I’d been wrong all along.","title":"The Curious Case of ChatGTP"},{"content":"This page acknowledges and credits the people, projects, and platforms that help power VirtualSheep — from open source software to AI collaborators and creative assets.\nStatic Site Generator This site is built with Hugo — The world’s fastest framework for building websites.\nTheme: PaperMod A fast, clean, responsive Hugo theme.
